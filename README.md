## Skills

### /mikey:testify

Review and align tests with test philosophy. Identifies code design issues, implementation detail testing, excessive mocking, and negative test coverage gaps — then suggests or implements improvements.

See [mikey/skills/testify/SKILL.md](mikey/skills/testify/SKILL.md) for more information.

### /mikey:tdd

TDD workflow driven by Given/When/Then specifications. Provide a spec file or folder path for autonomous batch processing, or run interactively for one-at-a-time TDD loops. Applies Functional Core / Imperative Shell design principles.

## Releasing

1. Update `plugin.json` version
2. Commit changes
3. Create an annotated tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "summary of changes"
   git push origin main vX.Y.Z
   ```

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) automatically creates a GitHub release from the tag.
